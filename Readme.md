This project was built using WPF and the .Net Framework 4.6.1, and is a
GUI for the
[Brigandine GE Data Editor Library](https://github.com/DStilwagen/Brigandine-GE-Data-Editor).

The GUI is very simple, with a list of the different data types at the
top. Selecting any of the DataTypes will display a DataGrid with columns
for displaying the fields in each DataType.

># Brigandine GE Data Editor Library
> I built this library to make viewing and/or editing things like names,
> descriptions, and stats in Brigandine Grand Edition easier. The
> MemoryAccessor class encapsulates the functionality for reading and
> writing to the SLPS_026.61/62 file. The SLPS_026 files are on the
> original BGE disks or images of the disks, for more information see:
> [About SLPS_026.61/62](#About-SLPS_026.61/62). Included in the library
> is a default data resource that contains a slightly modified version
> of the english translation that can be found here
> [Brigandine Grand Edition English Translation](https://www.swordofmoonlight.com/bbs/index.php?topic=869.0),
> more information can be found in the [Default Data](#Default-Data)
